University of California, Irvine

# About this Course:
You will learn to extend your knowledge of making iOS apps so that they can securely interact with web services and receive push notifications. You'll learn how to store data securely on a device using Core Data.  Youâ€™ll also learn to securely deploy apps to the App Store and beta users over-the-air.

The format of the course is through a series of code tutorials.  We will walk you through the creation of several apps that you can keep as a personal app toolbox.  When you make your own apps after this course, you can bring in these capabilities as needed.  When necessary we pop out of the code tutorials to talk about concepts at a higher level so that what you are programming makes sense.

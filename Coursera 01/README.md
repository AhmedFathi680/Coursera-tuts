# About this Course:
An introduction to the Objective-C programming language.  This will prepare you for more extensive iOS app development and build a foundation for advanced iOS development topics.

Objective-C programming requires a Mac laptop or desktop computer.  An iOS device is optional if the learner is willing to working exclusively with the simulator.  Some learners have been able to work with an OS X virtual machine on Windows, but explaining how to do that is beyond the scope of this course.
